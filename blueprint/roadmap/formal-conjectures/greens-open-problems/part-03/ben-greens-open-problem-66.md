The file states 2 research or textbook statements: 1 open and 1 solved.

## `Green66.green_66`

Open: stated without proof.

> Is there always a sum of two squares between $X - \frac{1}{10}X^{1/4}$ and $X$?
> We formalize this as an eventual statement for sufficiently large real $X$.

```lean
theorem green_66 :
    ∀ᶠ X : ℝ in atTop,
      ∃ n : ℕ, IsSumOfTwoSquares n ∧
        (n : ℝ) ∈ Set.Icc (X - (1 / 10 : ℝ) * X ^ (1 / 4 : ℝ)) X
```

## `Green66.green_66.variants.trivial_bound`

Proved here.

> Green notes that a well-known, almost trivial argument gives an $O(X^{1/4})$ bound on the left.

```lean
theorem green_66.variants.trivial_bound :
    ∃ C > (0 : ℝ), ∀ᶠ X : ℝ in atTop,
      ∃ n : ℕ, IsSumOfTwoSquares n ∧
        (n : ℝ) ∈ Set.Icc (X - C * X ^ (1 / 4 : ℝ)) X
```

## Depends on

No dependencies are recorded: this chapter reads Formal Conjectures' source text without running Lean, which edges between statements need.
